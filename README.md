# Advent of Code Private Leaderboard in Dash
Dash app that loads and parses Advent of Code leadboard json

Uses `dcc.Upload` and `dcc.Store` to load and store JSON from the AoC API, which is then parsed into pandas dataframes and figures by [aoc_scoreboard](https://github.com/astrowonk/aoc_scoreboard).

The app is [running live on my web site](https://marcoshuerta.com/dash/aoc/), go check it out there!
